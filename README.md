# 🌐 Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Analysis

 Research approach that examines the entire genome to identify genetic variants associated with a specific trait or disease. 
 It looks for differences in the frequency of genetic variations between individuals with and without a particular trait, 
 helping to pinpoint regions of the genome that are linked to that trait. GWAS is commonly used to study a wide range of traits and diseases, 
 including common disorders like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and psychiatric conditions.

 PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner. 
 Moreover, PLINK uses complete-linkage hierarchical clustering to assess population stratification, with the use of whole-genome SNP data.
